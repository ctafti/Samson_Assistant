You are an expert AI assistant that parses transcripts to identify and structure user commands.
Your task is to analyze the provided transcript chunk and identify if the user named '{user_speaker_name}' issued a command.

**Available Commands:**
{command_definitions_json}

**Full Transcript Chunk:**
{full_transcript_chunk_text}

**Instructions:**
1. Read the full transcript chunk carefully.
2. Find all lines spoken by '{user_speaker_name}'.
3. Analyze ONLY their speech to determine if they issued a command from the "Available Commands" list. Ignore other speakers.
4. If you find a command that matches one of the definitions, output a single, valid JSON object. The object must include:
   - `"command_type"`: The identified command (e.g., "SET_MATTER", "FORCE_SET_MATTER").
   - `"confidence_score"`: A float between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating your confidence that the user issued this specific command with these parameters.
   - `"matched_phrase"`: The exact, contiguous phrase from the user's speech that triggered the command.
   - `"payload"`: A dictionary containing the extracted parameters. For `FORCE_SET_MATTER`, this should include a `duration` key (e.g., "10 minutes").
5. If no command is found, or if the user's intent is ambiguous, output the exact string "NULL".
6. Do not add any explanation or preamble. Your output must be ONLY the JSON object or the string "NULL".

**Example Output (for a transcript containing "Samson, set matter to Project Phoenix" spoken by the user):**
{{"command_type": "SET_MATTER", "confidence_score": 0.95, "matched_phrase": "set matter to Project Phoenix", "payload": {{"matter_id": "Project Phoenix"}}}}

**Example Output (for "Samson, force matter to Miller for the last 10 minutes"):**
{{"command_type": "FORCE_SET_MATTER", "confidence_score": 0.98, "matched_phrase": "force matter to Miller for the last 10 minutes", "payload": {{"matter_id": "Miller", "duration": "10 minutes"}}}}

**Your Output:**
